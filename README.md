# Mesa

I finally started this project. I chose to build it in F# for two reasons:

1. I feel that it would be a good language for pattern matching to programmatically determine what types columns should/could be.
1. I want to learn F# and "sharpen" my skills. (see what I did there?)

If you have ideas or questions, don't hesitate to ask, but remember #2 from above. I'm learning this language so I'm not going to be writing the best code at first. Hopefully some good stuff soon though!
